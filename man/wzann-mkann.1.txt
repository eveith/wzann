NAME
----

wzann-mkann - Creates a JSON-serialized Artificial Neural Network definition

SYNOPSIS
--------

*wzann-mkann* *-p* 'PATTERN' *-l* 'LAYER' [*-l* 'LAYER' ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*wzann-mkann* creates a JSON-serialized Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The
definition is compatible with all tools that use the wzann library, such as
*wzann-train*.

*wzann-mkann* can only create ANN definitions for which a pattern exists. The
command line option *-P*|*--list-patterns* lists all available patterns. The
patterns define the general structure of the ANN as well as how a value is
calculated. How many layers and neurons an ANN contains and what activation
functions are used is determined by repeatedly supplying the
*-l*|*--add-layer* flag.

The resulting ANN is written to STDOUT.

OPTIONS
-------

*-p*, *--pattern*='PATTERN'::
    Defines the pattern that, in turn, defines the general structure of the
    ANN. See *-P*.

*-l*, *--add-layer*='LAYER'::
    Adds a layer to the ANN. All layer definitions must be simple layer
    definitions, which follow the form 'NUM-NEURONS'*:*'ACTIVATION-FUNCTION'.
    The number of neurons in the layer ('NUM-NEURONS') must be an unsigned
    integer (> 0); the name of the activation function ('ACTIVATION-FUNCTION')
    one of the known activation functions. This option may be supplied
    multiple time; each new occurrence adds a new layer. How layers are
    arranged or how many layers an ANN may hold depends on the pattern used.
    See *-A*.

*-P*, *--list-patterns*::
    Prints a list of all available patterns, each being a suitable argument
    for *-p*.

*-A*, *--list-activation-functions*::
    Prints a list of all recognized activation functions, suitable for usage
    in the simple layer definition supplied by giving the *-l* flag.

*-h*, *--help*::
    Prints a usage summary and exits the program.

*-v*, *--version*::
    Prints the current version of the program.

EXIT STATUS
-----------

0 on success, 1 on failure (mostly due to malformatted input).

EXAMPLE
-------

    wzann-mkann -p wzann::ElmanNetworkPattern -l 1:ReLU -l 5:Logistic
        -l 2:Logistic
